      We had so many sign ups for our June event that we had to squeeze an extra
      date in for July to meet demand, which was both incredibly flattering and
      a bit hectic to arrange!\

      But it was another great night with top people and lots of laughter so it
      was all worth it. Massive thank you to everyone who came along.
